My AI project . Don't know where we heading.

# Progrssion
  - Get to know Image pre-processing step (skimage,matplotlib)
  - Try to implement Deep learning Algorithms (InceptionV3, ResNet50)
  - Clean image(Crop size to 224x224,change to grayscale)
  - Explore how to make "Model"
  - split data into 2 side => 80% for train , 20% for test
  - first configuration for InceptionV3
